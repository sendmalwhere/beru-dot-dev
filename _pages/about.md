# Hey.
I'm Mallory Reu. My pronouns are she/her.

I'm a Senior Site Reliability Engineer working at Lambda in San Francisco, California. In the past, I've also worked at Google, Cisco, Meraki, AMP Robotics, ActBlue.

This blog is just a little self-hosted project designed to give me a place to show off some of the cool stuff I work on.
